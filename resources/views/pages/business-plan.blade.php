      Industry Overview
          </h2>

      <p class="mt-4 max-w-2xl text-md text-gray-500">
            The tourist and hotel business in the United States currently generates $18 billion in
        revenue. In South Florida, general occupancy is increasing, with rates ranging from 70
        to 80 percent in different locales. This isn&#39;t far off from what the figures were before
        COVID at the same time of year. Most of these improvements came from leisure travel,
        which accounts for around $500 billion of the $800 billion spent on travel in the state
        each year. However, while commercial flights to South Florida have recently increased,
        “the same cannot be said for business travel” as a whole. As a result, different property
        types and locations are affected differently, seaside resorts fare better than downtown
        business hotels. The goal is that as more people become vaccinated, larger-scale
        conventions and normal business trips will return to South Florida, filling hotel rooms
        once more. It&#39;s also worth noting that hotel overnight rates haven&#39;t dropped significantly,
        as there&#39;s still enough demand to maintain them close to usual levels.
