                    Industry Overview
                </h2>

                <p class="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-md text-gray-500">
                    The tourist and hotel business in the United States currently generates $18 billion in
                    revenue. In South Florida, general occupancy is increasing, with rates ranging from 70
                    to 80 percent in different locales. This isn&#39;t far off from what the figures were before
                    COVID at the same time of year. Most of these improvements came from leisure travel,
                    which accounts for around $500 billion of the $800 billion spent on travel in the state
                    each year. However, while commercial flights to South Florida have recently increased,
                    “the same cannot be said for business travel” as a whole. As a result, different property
                    types and locations are affected differently, seaside resorts fare better than downtown
                    business hotels. The goal is that as more people become vaccinated, larger-scale
                    conventions and normal business trips will return to South Florida, filling hotel rooms
                    once more. It&#39;s also worth noting that hotel overnight rates haven&#39;t dropped significantly,
                    as there&#39;s still enough demand to maintain them close to usual levels.
