        Objective
    </h5>
    <p class="text-sm">
        At The 305 Total Experience. To demonstrate our services, we must target and specific
        market segment. We&#39;ll start promoting each subsidiary 6 months ahead of time, and
        even before they&#39;re up and running. Each subsidiary&#39;s marketing expenditure is
        projected to be $100,000 all factors included. We&#39;ll be concentrating our efforts on social
        media, YouTube ads, and websites. Given that our primary customers are young adults,
        young couples and even families we believe that social media (Instagram, Facebook,
        Twitter) and television commercials are the most effective ways to reach them.

        Action Plan
    </h5>
    <p class="text-sm">

        Our marketing campaign will be directed and executed by the 305 Total Experience. Yours
        marketing director together with our talented marketing group. The idea is for one group to
        concentrate on social media and through this design algorithms to target and attract our
        market segment/target audience. They&#39;ll also use Google, and other search engines to promote
        themselves. According to studies conducted by The 305 Total Experience, each click generates
        $2 for the business and $1 for Google. It reaches around 2 billion individuals and automatically
        locates your company&#39;s advertisement on websites like your industry.
        Each subsidiary will get a $25,000 budget for the social media team. We calculated that this
        sum would be sufficient to cover all social media sites, as well as Google and YouTube ads. Our
        goal with social media is to recruit young couples while also promoting our values and services.
        We&#39;ll also use it to promote events, promotions, menus, and new attractions, among other
        things. We also want to use social media to work hand by hand with influencers in the
        hospitality industry, to spread brand awareness and attract new customers.
        Influencers play a huge role in social media branding nowadays, and there&#39;s nothing better than
        hearing real opinions and experiences from branding experts. We will invite the selected
        influencer group to meet our associates and participate in full brand experiences, with a
        predetermined budget of $150 per individual, which they have previously factored into their
        budget. After the first visit, the frequency will be determined based on new brand launches.
