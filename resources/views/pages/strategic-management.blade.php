The 305 Total Experience as part of Miami&#39;s society is fully aware of the changes that we are
currently suffering. for that motive we implemented new ways to offer our services, always
having our customers well-being as our priority.
Our restaurants will offer free deliveries to those customers lodging at the sea view hotel
​ our customers that want to visit fair child garden or Vizcaya Museum will receive special tickets
that will allow them to have private tours, lunch provided by the venues, and the possibility to
become volunteers without any additional cost.
In addition, as the hurricane season begins, The 305 Total Experience is prepared to confront
this issue. Our subsidiaries are fully equipped with shutters and anti-hurricane windows. we
also installed electricity generators in each of our subsidiaries in case power goes out. 

DISCIPLINE PLAN
The 305 Total Experience has a strict discipline policy, our discipline actions are braked
as following:
1. violations of rule and code of ethics will have the following consequences:
a. counseling and verbal Waring:  the direct supervisor of the employee that
committed the infraction will give him/her a verbal warning in which the
supervisor will discuss the nature of the problem or the violation of company
policies and procedures. The supervisor is expected to clearly describe
expectations and steps the employee must take to improve his or her performance
or resolve the problem.
Within five business days, the supervisor will prepare written documentation of
the verbal counseling. The employee will be asked to sign this document to
demonstrate his or her understanding of the issues and the corrective action.
b. written warning: During this step, the immediate supervisor and a division
manager or director will meet with the employee to review any additional
incidents or information about the performance, conduct or attendance issues as
well as any prior relevant corrective action plans. Management will outline the
consequences for the employee of his or her continued failure to meet
performance or conduct expectations. The written warning will also include a
statement indicating that the employee may be subject to additional discipline, up
to and including termination, if immediate and sustained corrective action is not
taken.
c. second written warning and suspension: in this step the employee will receive a
second written warning stating that he/she did not meet with the expectations and
did not showed improvement on the previous warning.  When immediate action is
necessary to ensure the safety of the employee or others, the immediate
supervisor may suspend the employee pending the results of an investigation.

Depending on the seriousness of the infraction, the employee may be suspended
without pay in
full day increments consistent with federal, state, and local wage and hour
employment laws.
HR will provide guidance to ensure that the discipline is administered without
jeopardizing the FLSA exemption status.
Pay may be restored to the employee if an investigation of the incident or
infraction absolves the employee of wrongdoing.
d. Termination: 
The last and most serious step in the progressive discipline process is a
recommendation to terminate employment. Generally, The 305 Total Experience
will try to exercise the progressive nature of this policy by first providing warnings,
issuing a final written warning, or suspending the employee from the workplace
before proceeding to a recommendation to terminate employment. However,
entertainment reserves the right to combine and skip steps depending on the
circumstances of each situation and the nature of the offense. Furthermore,
employees may be terminated without prior notice or disciplinary action.
Management&#39;s recommendation to terminate employment must be approved by
human resources (HR) and the division director or designate. Final approval may be
required from the CEO or designate.
  
2. Illegal activity: The 305 Total Experience entertainment has a very strict ethical
conduct, any of the following illegal activities may carry immediate termination
upon investigation:
Accounting or auditing irregularities
Theft
Fraud, waste, or abuse
Disclosure of proprietary information
Misuse of Argonne equipment
Improper dealings with customers or vendors
Sale or possession of illicit controlled substances
Working while under the influence of illicit controlled substances or alcohol
Discrimination or harassment based on age, ancestry, citizenship status, color,
disability, gender (including sexual harassment), gender identity, genetic
information, marital status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sexual
orientation, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law.
if any of these activities also jeopardizes the well-being of the company or his
employees legal actions may be taken against the offender.
