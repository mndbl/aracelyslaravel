    Macro Environment: 
    </p><p class="text-justify text-sm px-4 "> There are certain factors in macro-environment that could
    affect decision making and strategies of organizations. Changes in Tax, Imposition of
    policies, Increasing or Reducing Trade Barriers, Cultural &amp; Demographic Changes and
    Changes in Political Environment &amp; Government Policy are some of the key examples of
    macro environment. These could bring certain positives as well as negatives for every
    business. PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal)
    Analysis is a tool which is widely used by business managers for analysis of such critical
    factors. It is very helpful for development of strategic decision making for the purpose of
    improving business.
